In this paper, we present a capacitive bridge-based duplexer for full-duplex operation with tunable Tx/Rx insertion loss to improve link budget in an asymmetric data network. Theoretical analysis is done to show that capacitive bridge-based duplexer can be better than hybrid transformer in CMOS process. Capacitive bridge architecture is suitable for insertion loss tunability and this tunability gives an additional advantage of increasing the range of allowed antenna impedance for the given balance network. The fully integrated duplexer with receiver is implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process, and is capable of handling Tx power of upto +16dBm at antenna. The prototype chip demonstrates tunable Tx/Rx insertion loss achieving an overall receiver noise figure of 5.7-7.5dB and a Tx insertion loss of 3.9-5.6dB.

	abstract = {Ground-bounce due to bond wire inductance is a well known problem in Radio-Frequency (RF) Integrated Circuits. In this paper we propose the use of series resonance with an extra bond wire to substantially reduce ground-bounce effects in narrowband RF front-ends. Instability caused by the ground bond wire is also tackled. Impedance balancing of output stage to null ground-bounce due to other on-chip circuitry is discussed. The proposed techniques are applied to the design of a power amplifier (PA) for 2.5GHz applications and detailed simulations are performed to support the same.},

	abstract = {This work presents a wide tuning range LC-VCO (Voltage controlled oscillator) covering 6.53 GHz to 10.85 GHz. Novelty of the work lies in using just a single-turn inductor for dual-mode resonance while avoiding any switch in the supply path. The VCO has been designed in 65 nm CMOS technology occupying an active area of 0.0492 mm2 and having a tuning range of 49.7\%. The proposed VCO has more than 2x lower area than other wide-tuning LC VCOs in similar frequency range. The post-layout simulated FOMA for this VCO is between 197.18 dBc/Hz to 198.98 dBc/Hz.},
