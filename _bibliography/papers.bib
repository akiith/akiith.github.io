The proposed digital edge combining approach offers broadband operation with low-power and low-area advantages and is a promising candidate for low-power frequency synthesis in deep submicrometer {CMOS} technologies. Chip prototype of the proposed frequency multiplication-based 2.4-{GHz} binary frequency-shift-keying ({BFSK})/amplitude shift keying ({ASK}) transmitter ({TX}) was fabricated in 0.13-μm {CMOS} technology. The {TX} achieves maximum data rates of 3 and 20 Mb/s for {BFSK} and {ASK} modulations, respectively, consuming a 14-{mA} current from 1.3 V supply voltage. The corresponding energy efficiencies of the {TX} are 3.6 {nJ}/bit for {BFSK} and 0.91 {nJ}/bit for {ASK} modulations.},

	title = {A Single-Turn Inductor based Compact and Wide-Tuning {LC}-{VCO} using Dual-Resonant Modes},
	abstract = {This work presents a wide tuning range {LC}-{VCO} (Voltage controlled oscillator) covering 6.53 {GHz} to 10.85 {GHz}. Novelty of the work lies in using just a single-turn inductor for dual-mode resonance while avoiding any switch in the supply path. The {VCO} has been designed in 65 nm {CMOS} technology occupying an active area of 0.0492 mm2 and having a tuning range of 49.7\%. The proposed {VCO} has more than 2x lower area than other wide-tuning {LC} {VCOs} in similar frequency range. The post-layout simulated {FOMA} for this {VCO} is between 197.18 {dBc}/Hz to 198.98 {dBc}/Hz.},
